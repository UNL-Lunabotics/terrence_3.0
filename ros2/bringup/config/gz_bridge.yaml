# REMOVE CMD_VEL
# ros2_control listens to the ROS topic /cmd_vel directly and moves the joints.
# You do not need to bridge this to Gazebo unless you are debugging.

# REMOVE ODOMETRY
# Your diff_drive_controller is already publishing this to /odom.
# Bridging it here causes interference.

# REMOVE TF
# Your diff_drive_controller publishes odom -> base_link
# Your robot_state_publisher publishes base_link -> laser_frame
# SLAM Toolbox will publish map -> odom
# Bridging TF from Gazebo will break this chain.
